# Object-oriented programming Project
This is a replica of the classic game Space Invaders made entirely in Java with no assistance from game engines of any kind.

## About
This project was completed as the final project of an Object-oriented Programming course. The challenge was to develop a fully working game using raw Java, without any assets or resources from an external game engine. The game runs on the generic public loop mechanism for Java, incorporating proprietary logic and assets.
